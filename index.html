                Hi! My name is Ted Peters and I'm currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; My passions include software engineering and finance. I'm particularly interested in utilizing technology to build applications
                that increase accessibility to financial services and strengthen economic mobility. In the interest of expanding into new projects that showcase some of my abilities, I decided to create a personal website. Below you can find more information
                about me and my experience.

                With schools closed as a result of COVID-19, I saw firsthand how many students struggled to adapt to the online format. In order to help alleviate this problem, another graduate and I decided to start ShipMate, an online tutoring service. With over 25
                clients and 6 contracted tutors, ShipMate in under a year has earned roughly $20,000 in revenue and has helped countless students along the way

                As a dock worker, I've been able to cultivate personal relationships with customers day after day. This has helped me develop a service-oriented mindset as I've had to handle complaints and inquiries while providing the best possible experience.
