                Hi! My name is Ted Peters and I'm currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. My passions lie in software engineering and finance. In particular I'm interested in utilizing technology to build
                applications that increase accesibility to financial services and stregthen economic freedom/mobility. In order to expand into more projects as well as showcase some of my abilities, I decided to create a personal website. Below lies more

                With schools closed as a result of COVID-19, I saw firsthand how many students struggled to adapt to the online format. In order to help alleviate this problem, another graduate and I decided to start an online tutoring service that would become ShipMate.
                With over 25 clients, and 6 contracted tutors, Shipmate in under a year has garnered roughly $20,000 in revenue and has helped countless students in the process.

                As a dock worker I've been fortunate in that I'm able to cultivate personal relationships with customers firsthand. Day after day, this has helped me develop a service oriented mindset as I've had to handle complaints and inquiries whilst providing the
                best possible experience.
