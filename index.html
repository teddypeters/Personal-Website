                Hello! My name is Ted Peters and I am currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. My passions lie in software engineering and finance. In particular I'm interested in utilizing technology to build applications that increase accesibility to financial services and stregthen economic freedom/mobility. As such, I am currently a member of both the Finance Investment Society and Data Science Club here at UW. Additionally, in an effort to expand into more projects, this website is intended to showcase my experiences and abilties.

               With schools closed as a result of COVID-19, I saw firsthand how many students struggled to adapt to the online format. In order to help alleviate this problem, myself and another graduate decided to start an online tutoring service that would become ShipMate. With over 25 clients, and 6 contracted tutors, Shipmate in under a year has garnered roughly $20,000 in revenue and has helped countless students in the process.

                   As a dock worker I've been fortunate in that I am able to cultivate personal relationships with customers firsthand. Day after day this has helped me develop a customer service mindset as I've had to handle complaints and inquiries whilst providing the best possible service.
