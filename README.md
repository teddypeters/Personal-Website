This website is meant to showcase some of my abilities in regards to web development. In creating this website, I relied on many external resources both to learn more
and to add more advanced functionality. Below are linked the websites I relied on throughout this project. Additionally, code that was not written by myself was 
quoted in the documents with links to the original work as well as disclaimers. Again, this project is soley for personal development and growth and not in any means 
a business endeavor. Feel free to contact me with any questions.
